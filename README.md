# heuriskó

> The Greek verb "heuriskó" primarily means to find or discover something, whether it be a physical object, a person, or an abstract concept such as truth or understanding. It can also imply obtaining or acquiring something through effort or search. In the New Testament, it is often used in contexts where something lost is found, or where a truth or revelation is discovered. - [BibleHub](https://biblehub.com/greek/2147.htm)

This is designed to be a self-hostable API to store and search through any set of transcripts.

My intention is to provide a solution to search through sermons and related lectures to find ranked, relevant results containing the time-stamps of the original sources extremely fast.

I do recognize that this can have value beyond the particular scope for which it was made.
Perhaps I will create something similar to index documents in the future.
